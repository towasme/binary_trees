# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Learning Objectives

### General

    What is a binary tree
    What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
    What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
    What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
    What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
    What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Requirements

### General


    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    You are allowed to use the standard library
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded
